        <h2>Damelia Coleman</h2>
        <p>I am an intellectually curious individual. I like to figure out how things work. 
            I have a creative mindset, I am visually learner, thus, colours are very important in how I understand things.
            I hope become a User Interface Designer for mobile applications and a Graphic Designer on the side. I love designing,
            however, I have a few weak points that I intend to work on. I love speaking to new people everyday but I also tend to shy away from people too.
